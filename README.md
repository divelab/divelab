Welcome to the Data Integration, Visualization, and Exploration (DIVE) Laboratory. Our research interests include machine learning, deep learning, data mining, and computational biology, etc. 
Specifically, we focus on many aspects in graph deep learning, such as graph generation, self-supervised learning, explainability, and 3D graphs, 
with applications on molecule generation and property prediction, etc.
